[Workshop program](\assets\img\blog\2017-04-01-2-day-workshop-on-gpu-based-neural-networking\machine_and_deep_learning_2days.pdf)

This training course is intended for developers willing to rapidly get NVIDIA-based AI technology into new and existing software solutions. In 2 days we will walk from the necessary theory of Recurrent and Convolutional Neural Networks to practical recipes of using Tensorflow and Caffe frameworks.

This progressive-format workshop dedicates two weekend days (6-7 May) to experimenting with the provided NVIDIA Tesla P100 system out of the classroom. Then on Monday we continue the course and address all questions collected over the weekend.
