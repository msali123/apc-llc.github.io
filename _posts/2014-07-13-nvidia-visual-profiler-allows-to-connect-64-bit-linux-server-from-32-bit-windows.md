In CUDA 6.0 release an extremely handy feature has been added to Visual Profiler: support for remote profiling. This means that you can run the profiler GUI from your local machine - laptop or tablet (even without GPU!), while profiling is performed on remote machine, e.g. company server or university cluster.

Moreover, it does not matter which operating system local machine is running. On our [screenshot](\assets\img\blog\2014-07-13-nvidia-visual-profiler-allows-to-connect-64-bit-linux-server-from-32-bit-windows/windows_profiler_linux_server.png) remote profiling on 64-bit Linux server is performed from Visual Profiler running on 32-bit Windows 8.
